## Components

- `App.js`: Main application component managing state and rendering
- `Controls.js`: Handles user input for tuning, scale, and root note

- `musicData.js`: Contains musical data (scales, tunings, notes)
- `noteCalculations.js`: Calculates fretboard notes based on tuning

## Customization

- Add new scales in `src/utils/musicData.js` by extending the `scales` array
- Add new tuning presets in `src/components/Controls.js` in the `tuningPresets` object
